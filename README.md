Tic-tac-toe! You can view the live project [here](https://xewar.github.io/tic-tac-toe/).

This project was helpful for getting more practice using factory functions and the module pattern. I had read and followed the links on [this page](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/factory-functions-and-the-module-pattern) on the Odin Project prior to beginning, but I still didn't have a good grasp of the syntax or how scope and closure worked with them.

The hardest part of the project was figuring out how to check for a winner. I was hoping to use sets, but I learned that you have to use loops to do set operations in Javascript so I used arrays instead.

**Future updates**
